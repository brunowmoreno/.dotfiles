# My .dotfiles

Move on, nothing to see here... unless you use `ls -a`... haha, I made a shell joke.

Basic assumptions are that you use `zsh` and have it installed, that you have `curl`, `git` and `vim` installed. If you don't like anything that has been done, you can find your old .dotfiles in .dotfiles-old.

There are a bunch of random shell scripts in here too. There are all for linux, when certain things aren't installed already. Ignore them. They are for me because I am lazy and I had no other place to logically save them.

## Instructions
1. Read through the bootstrap.sh script to see and understand what is going to happen.
2. Run the bootstrap.sh script.
3. Restart your computer (helps on Linux if running gnome).
